                Cash Lendings can help you get out of an emergency financial situation. Thousands of Americans across
                the country use personal loans to help them pay for emergency expenses like medical expenses, mechanic
                fees, and bills. When searching for a loan you may see services like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

            <p>How does Cash Lendings work? We are not a lender but a lender connection service. We save you the work
                from filling out multiple websites by working with multiple lending partners. Once you submit your
                information online, if approved, you will be redirected to a lender's website where you can review the
                terms of the loan, including details about all the applicable rates and fees. If you accept these terms,
                the lender may be able to deposit money directly into your bank account as quickly as the next business
                day. </p>
            <p><strong>Representative Example:</strong> If you borrow $5,000 on a 36 month repayment term and at a 10%
                APR, the monthly repayment will be $161.34. Total repayment will be $5,808.24. Total interest paid will
                be $808.24. </p>
            <p><strong>APR Information:</strong> The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the rate at which your loan accrues
                interest. It is based upon the amount of your loan, cost of the loan, term of the loan, repayment
                amounts and timing of payments and payoff. By law, the lender or lending partner must show you the APR
                before you enter into the loan. Rates, loan size, among other variables will vary based on your credit
                worthiness with the lower rates potentially available to customers with excellent credit. Minimum and
                maximum loan amounts and APRs may vary according to state law and lender or lending partner. We
                recommend you read the lending partner's terms and conditions in full before proceeding for a loan.</p>
            <p><strong>Renewal Policy:</strong> Every lender has its own terms and conditions and renewal policy, which
                may differ from lender to lender. You should review your lender's terms and renewal policy before
                signing the loan agreement. Late payments of loans may result in additional fees or collection
                activities, or both.</p>
            <p><strong>Late, Partial, or Non-Payments and Collections:</strong> A loan is an agreement between you and
                the lender to fully repay the loan by the time agreed. Depending on your agreement with your lender, if
                you are late for the agreed payment, a lender may add fees, send to a collections agency, and/or report
                your late, partial or non payment to a consumer reporting agency. These policies change per lender, so
                please make sure to consult your lender to find their respective policies.</p>

                            The Annual Percentage Rate is the rate at which your loan accrues interest. It is based upon
                            the amount of your loan, cost of the loan, term of the loan, repayment amounts and timing of
                            payments and payoff. By law, the lender or lending partner must show you the APR before you
                            enter into the loan. Rates, loan size, among other variables will vary based on your credit
                            worthiness with the lower rates potentially available to customers with excellent credit.
                            Minimum and maximum loan amounts and APRs may vary according to state law and lender or
