By using our service, you consent to such sharing and to the receipt of marketing offers. You cannot opt out of such sharing and still use our service. If you do not consent to such sharing, you must discontinue your loan request. Once you have submitted and received a decision on your initial loan request, we may use and share (and permit nonaffiliated third parties to use and share) your information to market other credit and non-credit products and services to you, unless prohibited by law or by an agreement between us and your lender. You can choose not to permit use and sharing of your information by not agreeing to our Terms of Use. If you do not agree to our Terms of Use, in general, we cannot serve you. Our Terms of Use explain the circumstances under which we and our "marketing partners" (which are nonaffiliates) may, with your prior express written consent, communicate with you by phone and text using automatic telephone dialing systems.
