                    If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>

            <p><i>Deletion Request Rights</i></p>
            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
            <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>

                    Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
                </li>
                <li>

            <p></p>
            <p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
            <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
            <p>
            </p><ul>
                <li>
                    Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
            <p><i>Response Timing and Format</i></p>
            <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
            <p class="underline">Non-Discrimination</p>
            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
            <p>
            </p><ul>
                <li>
                    Deny you goods or services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p class="underline">Changes to Our Privacy Notice</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this privacy notice, we will notify you by email or through a notice on our website homepage.</p>
