            <p>
                A common question we get is: how much will I be charged for taking out a personal loan?
                The answer is simple and a bit complicated at the same time. Your fee will be based on the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of your loan.
            </p>
            <span class="title">
					What is the APR on the loan?

            <p>
                <strong>Please note</strong>: <?=$_ENV['APP_DOMAIN']?> is not a lender and does not provide loans but aims to connect consumers to lenders who may provide such loans. <?=$_ENV['APP_DOMAIN']?> is unable to supply you with an exact APR (Annual Percentage Rate) that you will be charged if you are approved for a loan. APRs vary according to the information supplied by you in your loan request and your lender. You will be given the APR, loan fees, and other terms by your lender when you are redirected to your loan agreement in the loan request process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The APR of the loan will vary depending on the loan amount, the duration of the loan, loan fees incurred, late payment fees, non-payment fees, loan renewal actions, and other factors. Keep in mind that the APR range is not your finance charge and your finance charge will be disclosed later on.
            </p>

                <?=$_ENV['APP_DOMAIN']?> is not a lender and does not charge any fees for its services. Every lender in the <?=$_ENV['APP_DOMAIN']?> network provides the consumer with specific terms, conditions, and practices prior to the consumer's acceptance of the loan. We recommend that you carefully review the terms and conditions of any loan offer presented to you.

					Implications of Non-Payment, Late Payment, or Partial Payment
				</span>
            <p>
                When you accept the terms and conditions for a loan offer, you are agreeing to pay back the loan principal and finance charges in the amount of time shown in the documents supplied by your lender. Additional fees or charges by your lender may apply in the event that you are unable to repay your loan in full or if you make a late payment. <?=$_ENV['APP_DOMAIN']?> cannot predict the amount of the fees or charges that you will incur as a result of non-payment, late payment, or partial payment. <?=$_ENV['APP_DOMAIN']?> has no control of knowledge of the loan details between you and your lender. Please refer to the late payment, partial payment, and non-payment policies detailed in the loan documents provided by your lender. <?=$_ENV['APP_DOMAIN']?> does make an effort to work only with reputable lenders dedicated to pursuing collections of past due accounts in a fair and reasonable manner.
