                <h4>LOAN CONNECTING SERVICE</h4>

                Our loan connecting service connects consumers with lead purchasers as defined in <a href="<?=\yii\helpers\Url::toRoute(['site/apply'])?>">Certain Disclosures About Lead Generation</a>. To use the service, you must complete one or more online forms that request specific information from you, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number, banking account information and employment information. By doing so, you are not applying to us for credit.
                <br>
                <br>Once you submit your request form(s) online, we will share your information with one or more participating lead purchasers. Lead purchasers who receive your information from us may review your information to determine whether your information meets their loan qualification criteria. Lead purchasers may, among other things, verify your social security number, perform a credit check, and review your information against national databases (such as Teletrack, DP Bureau or DataX) that track consumer transactions with lending institutions and other credit-related data. By submitting the request form(s), you agree to allow lead purchasers to obtain, review, verify and research your information.
                <br>
                <br>If a lead purchaser determines that the information you submitted meets its loan qualification criteria, we will open a new web page belonging to the lead purchaser, or redirect your browser to the lead purchaser's web site. You understand and agree that, once you have been redirected to the lead purchaser's web site, we have no further involvement in the loan request or approval process. Your subsequent interactions with the lead purchaser are subject to the privacy policy, terms of use, and other policies and/or terms enforced by that lead purchaser.
                <br>

                <br><br>Additionally, if you are seeking a particular form of credit for which you do not qualify, you may receive solicitations for a form of credit that you are not seeking.
